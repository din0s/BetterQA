[*] There's an issue where the class page might not render with CSS upon redirecting for the first time.

This is an issue with Next.js and it gets fixed if you reload the page (Ctrl/Cmd + R).

This behavior is only present on the dev environment,Z as far as I'm aware.

Issue: next.js/[#8400](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/8400)
